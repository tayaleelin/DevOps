# Pulumi

In my road to finding out efficient DevOps tools, I came across a very valuable tool called: "Pulumi".
Pulumi is an advanced tool that gives the possibility to create "universal infrastructure as code" for the core cloud vendors: 'AWS', 'Microsoft Azure' and 'Google Cloud'. 
Writing code for these platforms can be done by using the code a development team is already programming in, such as:'Python', 'C#', 'TypeScript' and more.

The Pulumi engine is an automation api that gives the possibility to deploy resources using multiple methods as shown in the following figure.
